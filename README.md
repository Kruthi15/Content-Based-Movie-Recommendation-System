# ðŸŽ¬ Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

This project recommends movies based on metadata (genres, cast, crew, keywords, overview) using a **content-based filtering approach** and **cosine similarity**.

##  Features

- Recommends movies similar to a given title
- Uses NLP to preprocess movie metadata
- Implements cosine similarity for finding related movies
- Cleaned and engineered features from TMDB dataset
- Simple Python implementation, ready for deployment

##  How it Works

1. Load and merge movie and credits datasets
2. Extract features: genres, keywords, cast (top 3), director, overview
3. Clean and preprocess text (lowercase, stemming, stop word removal)
4. Create a combined feature (`tags`) column
5. Convert text to vectors using `CountVectorizer`
6. Compute cosine similarity between movie vectors
7. Recommend top N similar movies to a given input

##  Dataset

- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`
